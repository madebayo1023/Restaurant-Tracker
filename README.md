About the Project:
  
  Imagine you are craving that delicious, mouth watering meal from that one restaurant that your boyfriend’s aunt’s best friend’s neighbor’s yoga instructor told

  and family, and don’t hesitate to take advantage of the multitude of accessibility features found within the app.
